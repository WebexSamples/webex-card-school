# webex-card-school
This project provides a Webex Teams bot to introduce Webex Teams users to [Buttons and Cards](https://developer.webex.com/docs/api/guides/cards).   Through a series of lesons, each presented as a card, users learn what cards are, why applications may choose to use them, and some of the mechanics around designing and using cards.

As an open source sample, this app itself is part of the training and lessons link back to this source as well as the card source files.  While any Webex Teams user may interact with the bot, the content is aimed primarily towards developers who have some experience with creating bots, and who wish to add Buttons and Cards to their existing (or new!) applications.

To interact with this bot now, simply add cardSchool@webex.bot to a Webex Teams space.
